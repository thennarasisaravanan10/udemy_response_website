# udemy_response_website

I created a fully responsive Udemy-style landing page using HTML and CSS. 

The page adapts beautifully to different screen sizes — from desktops to tablets and mobiles — ensuring a seamless user experience. 

It features a modern layout with a navigation bar, banner section, course categories, featured courses, testimonials, and a clean footer. 

The design emphasizes simplicity, readability, and professional aesthetics, closely mimicking the user-friendly style of top e-learning platforms like Udemy. 

This project helped me improve my skills in responsive web design, Flexbox, media queries, and best practices in HTML and CSS structuring.
